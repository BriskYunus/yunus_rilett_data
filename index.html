                <h2>USA Men vs Women: Ice Hockey</h2>
                <p>In the USA data based on Ice Hockey it was recorded how much more men actually play the sport more than women. Over 60% are men. Icy hockey isn't as much popular as it is in Canada, but based off this data it is shown most that played during the Olympics were men.</p>

                <h2 id="before">Before and After 2000</h2>
                <p>Based on the data from before and after the year 2000, it shows a pretty balanced chart. One thing to notice is the fact that before gold metals were much higher than after 2000. It was over all pretty close with silver and bronze but clearly from the chart, gold was harder to achieve. In 2000 the Olympics were in Sydney.</p>

                <h2>Each Medal: China vs USA</h2>
                <p>In the charts below you can see all the stats for all medals from China and USA. In the charts it's clear to see how much more USA has won against China. Almost all over 90% with a huge overall total compared. Of course USA has always been more ahead in this case but it just goes to show that they are for sure one of the ones in the lead when it comes to the Olympics. This is just a show on how a certain country can have the lead while the other might not. Another thing to notice is that USA has almost the same amount with their silver and gold over China.</p>
